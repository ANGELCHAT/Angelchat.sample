## How it works?

[Agent App Extensions](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/) are web applications loaded inside the LiveChat Agent App. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the Agent’s App sidebar as you can see on pictures above.

To get information like tags and canned responses we need to use [LiveChat Rest Api](https://docs.livechatinc.com/rest-api/).

Rest Api requires you to include **access_token** in all requests in order to get information from our server. You can get it using [LiveChat Boilerplate](https://docs.livechatinc.com/boilerplate/) and [JavaScript Widget API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/#javascript-api).

You should also get familiar with [Authorization](https://docs.livechatinc.com/authorization/).
